This is a personal portfolio website designed and developed using HTML5 and CSS3. It showcases my career objective, technical skills, education background, projects, certifications, and contact information in a clean, responsive layout.

The portfolio serves as an interactive resume that highlights my journey as an aspiring software engineer and front-end developer. It was built from scratch without using any external frameworks to ensure full control over design and layout.
